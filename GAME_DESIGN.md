# 🎮 Jank Wars - Game Design

## 🕷️ Core Concept

**Revolutionary finger-controlled spider combat** where each finger directly controls a spider leg through real-time hand tracking. Players become digital puppeteers, creating an unprecedented connection between human gesture and avatar movement.

### The Magic Formula
```
Your Hand = Spider Controller
Each Finger = One Spider Leg
Physics + Chaos = Emergent Comedy
```

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### "Digital Puppeteer" Experience
- **Intuitive Interface**: "Fingers control legs" - instantly comprehensible
- **Impossible Mastery**: Coordinating 5+ fingers for locomotion is inherently difficult
- **Physics-Driven**: No scripted animations - everything emerges from realistic physics
- **Emergent Hilarity**: Failed coordination creates genuine comedy moments

### Player Journey
1. **Discovery** (0-2 min): "I can't believe this works!"
2. **Experimentation** (2-10 min): Learning basic finger coordination
3. **Competition** (10+ min): Spider-vs-spider combat mastery
4. **Expertise** (Ongoing): Developing signature finger techniques

## 🎮 Core Gameplay

### Spider Control System
```
Left Hand → Red Spider     Right Hand → Blue Spider
👍 Thumb  → Front-right    👍 Thumb  → Front-right
👆 Index  → Front-left     👆 Index  → Front-left
🖕 Middle → Mid-right      🖕 Middle → Mid-right
💍 Ring   → Mid-left       💍 Ring   → Mid-left
🤙 Pinky  → Back leg       🤙 Pinky  → Back leg
```

- If a hand is lost or disappears from view, the corresponding spider will enter a ragdoll physics state until the hand is re-detected.

### Movement Mechanics
- **Walking**: Alternating finger "steps" create natural spider gait
- **Running**: Rapid finger movements for speed bursts
- **Jumping**: Quick finger extension launches spider upward
- **Turning**: Palm rotation affects body orientation
- **Balancing**: Finger spread provides stability

### Combat System (In Development)
- **Pinch Gesture**: Precision strikes and grabs
- **Fist Gesture**: Power attacks and blocks
- **Open Palm**: Speed boosts and special abilities
- **Finger Combinations**: Advanced techniques and combos
