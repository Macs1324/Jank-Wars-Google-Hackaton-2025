# üï∑Ô∏è **Jank Wars - Game Vision Document**

## **üéØ Core Concept**

Jank Wars is a revolutionary 3D split-screen fighting game where players control spider-like ragdoll creatures using **direct finger movements captured via webcam**. Each spider leg is controlled by a specific finger, creating an unprecedented level of intuitive yet hilariously chaotic control.

The magic happens through **finger-to-leg mimicry**: when you curl your index finger, the spider's corresponding leg curls. When you spread your fingers wide, the spider spreads its legs. The spider becomes a perfect digital marionette controlled by your hand gestures.

## **üéÆ Gameplay Philosophy**

### **The "Digital Puppeteer" Experience**
- **Your Hand = The Controller**: No keyboards, no gamepads - pure hand gesture control
- **Each Finger = One Spider Leg**: Direct 1:1 mapping between finger pose and leg position
- **Physics-Driven Chaos**: Realistic ragdoll physics amplify every finger movement into emergent comedy
- **Skill Through Coordination**: Mastering finger choreography becomes the core gameplay skill

### **The Beautiful Struggle**
- **Simple to Understand**: "Move your fingers to move the spider legs" - instantly comprehensible
- **Impossible to Master**: Coordinating 5+ fingers for locomotion is inherently difficult
- **Emergent Hilarity**: Failed attempts create genuine comedy moments
- **Skill Ceiling**: Expert players develop finger techniques that look like magic

## **üï∑Ô∏è Spider Anatomy & Control**

### **Spider Design**
- **6-Legged Ragdoll**: Physics-simulated spider body with realistic joint constraints
- **Individual Leg Control**: Each leg responds to a specific finger independently
- **Realistic Physics**: Proper weight, momentum, and collision detection
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear color coding and visual feedback for leg-to-finger mapping

### **Finger-to-Leg Mapping**
```
Left Hand ‚Üí Player 1 (Red Spider):
  Thumb  ‚Üí Front-right leg
  Index  ‚Üí Front-left leg  
  Middle ‚Üí Middle-right leg
  Ring   ‚Üí Middle-left leg
  Pinky  ‚Üí Back-right leg
  Palm   ‚Üí Back-left leg (or body control)

Right Hand ‚Üí Player 2 (Blue Spider):
  [Same mapping for second player]
```

### **Movement Mechanics**
- **Walking**: Alternating finger "steps" create natural spider gait
- **Running**: Rapid finger movements for speed
- **Jumping**: Quick finger extension launches spider upward  
- **Grabbing**: Finger curling attempts to grip surfaces/opponents
- **Balancing**: Finger spread provides stability
- **Combat**: Finger gestures create strikes, blocks, grabs
