- [ ] Leg reaches target positions within acceptable tolerance
- [ ] Natural-looking leg movement and positioning

### **Milestone 4: Full Control**
- [ ] Both hands control their respective spiders completely
- [ ] Players can achieve basic spider locomotion through finger movements
- [ ] Spider walking achieved by "finger stepping" motions
- [ ] Combat interactions possible through finger gestures

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technical Decisions Needed**

### **Hand Tracking Technology Choice**
**Options Under Consideration**:
- **MediaPipe**: Professional hand tracking, 21 landmarks, excellent accuracy
- **OpenCV + Custom**: More control, potentially lighter weight
- **Web-based**: JavaScript MediaPipe with Tauri wrapper
- **Native Libraries**: Direct integration with C++ hand tracking

**Decision Criteria**:
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Performance (30+ FPS on modest hardware)
- Accuracy (reliable finger joint detection)
- Development complexity (time to implementation)

### **IK Solver Approach**
**Options**:
- **FABRIK**: Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics
- **CCD-IK**: Cyclic Coordinate Descent
- **Analytical**: Custom solution for spider leg geometry
- **Hybrid**: Combination approach for optimal performance

### **Finger Mapping Strategy**
**Questions to Resolve**:
- Should palm orientation affect spider body rotation?
- How to handle hand tracking loss gracefully?
- What dead zone size prevents jitter while maintaining responsiveness?
- Should finger mapping be customizable per player?

## **üîß Development Environment**

### **Current Setup**
- **Language**: Rust with Bevy game engine
- **Platform**: Linux (NixOS) development, cross-platform target
- **Camera**: USB webcam (320√ó240 minimum resolution)
- **Dependencies**: Minimal and stable (bevy, bevy_rapier3d, nokhwa)

### **Required Additions**
- Hand tracking library (TBD based on technology choice)
- IK solver library or custom implementation
- Additional math libraries for 3D transformations
- Performance profiling tools for optimization

## **üìä Risk Assessment**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Hand Tracking Performance**: May struggle on older hardware
- **IK Complexity**: Real-time solving for 12 legs (6 per player) may be CPU intensive
- **Latency Accumulation**: Hand detection + IK + physics may exceed 50ms target
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Different camera APIs across platforms

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Performance LOD**: Quality scaling based on hardware capabilities
- **Fallback Controls**: Keyboard/gamepad backup if hand tracking fails
- **Modular Architecture**: Hand tracking backend can be swapped
- **Early Testing**: Regular performance validation during development

## **üéÆ Current Playability**

### **What Works Right Now**
```bash
cargo run
# Result: Fully playable spider combat with keyboard controls
# - Two ragdoll spiders spawn and can be controlled
# - Physics simulation runs at stable 60 FPS
# - Visual feedback and debug tools functional
# - Webcam feed displays in corner (ready for hand tracking)
```

### **Development Commands**
- **Run Game**: `cargo run`
- **Physics Debug**: Press 'D' in-game to toggle wireframes
- **Inspector**: Press F12/ESC to open component inspector
- **Controls**: Arrow keys + 1-6 number keys for limb control

**Current Status: Solid Foundation Complete, Ready for Hand Tracking Implementation** üï∑Ô∏è

The core game engine, physics simulation, and spider ragdoll systems are fully functional. The webcam infrastructure is in place and ready to receive hand tracking data. The next phase is implementing the hand detection and finger-to-leg mapping that will transform this from a keyboard-controlled ragdoll game into the revolutionary finger-puppeteered spider combat experience envisioned.
